# ðŸ¤– Introduction


This website project is built using React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for the user interface, with Appwrite handling the Trending Movies Algorithm database. I created this project as a hands-on way to deepen my understanding of React.js and improve my front-end development skills.

Through this project, I'm exploring key concepts like component-based architecture, state management, API integration, and modern styling techniques. Itâ€™s a great way for me to practice building dynamic and responsive web applications while working with real-world technologies.
