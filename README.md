# Trending Movies App ðŸŽ¬

## Introduction
This project is a React.js-based web application that displays trending movies, built with JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Appwrite for database management. I created this project to deepen my understanding of React.js and enhance my front-end development skills.

Through this project, I explored key concepts such as:

âœ… Component-based architecture â€“ Modular and reusable UI components

âœ… State management â€“ Efficiently handling app data and UI updates

âœ… API integration â€“ Fetching and displaying movie data dynamically

âœ… Modern styling techniques â€“ Utilizing Tailwind CSS for sleek and responsive UI

## Technologies Used

React.js â€“ Front-end framework

JavaScript â€“ Core logic and interactivity

Tailwind CSS â€“ Utility-first styling

Appwrite â€“ Backend for the Trending Movies Algorithm
